Hello <b>{{ $data['name'] }}</b>! <br>

Congratulations on taking the first step towards joining our large team of online influencers!

<h5>How it works</h5>
<p>
    Working as an influencer is the easiest way to earn. You are given a content to promote you earn from the engagement generated from your promotion. You help our clients get their business out and you earn a side income. Itâ€™s a win-win for us all! This is an influencer package. If you are not an influencer, just register as a normal user.
